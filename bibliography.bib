	abstract = {Identifying security patches via code commits to allow early warnings and timely fixes for Open Source Software (OSS) has received increasing attention. However, the existing detection methods can only identify the presence of a patch (i.e., a binary classification) but fail to pinpoint the vulnerability type. In this work, we take the first step to categorize the security patches into fine-grained vulnerability types. Specifically, we use the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as the label and perform fine-grained classification using categories at the third level of the CWE tree. We first formulate the task as a Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC) problem, i.e., inferring a path (a sequence of CWE nodes) from the root of the CWE tree to the node at the target depth. We then propose an approach named TreeVul with a hierarchical and chained architecture, which manages to utilize the structure information of the CWE tree as prior knowledge of the classification task. We further propose a tree structure aware and beam search based inference algorithm for retrieving the optimal path with the highest merged probability. We collect a large security patch dataset from NVD, consisting of 6,541 commits from 1,560 GitHub OSS repositories. Experimental results show that Tree-vulsignificantly outperforms the best performing baselines, with improvements of 5.9%, 25.0%, and 7.7% in terms of weighted F1-score, macro F1-score, and MCC, respectively. We further conduct a user study and a case study to verify the practical value of TreeVul in enriching the binary patch detection results and improving the data quality of NVD, respectively.},

@inproceedings{dunlap2024vfcfinder:,
	abstract = {Security advisories are the primary channel of communication for discovered vulnerabilities in open-source software, but they often lack crucial information. Specifically, 63\% of vulnerability database reports are missing their patch links, also referred to as vulnerability fixing commits (VFCs). This paper introduces VFCFinder, a tool that generates the top-five ranked set of VFCs for a given security advisory using Natural Language Programming Language (NL-PL) models. VFCFinder achieves a 96.6\% recall for finding the correct VFC within the Top-5 commits, and an 80.0\% recall for the Top-1 ranked commit. VFCFinder generalizes to nine different programming languages and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 36 percentage points in terms of Top-1 recall. As a practical contribution, we used VFCFinder to backfill over 300 missing VFCs in the GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) database. All of the VFCs were accepted and merged into the GHSA database. In addition to demonstrating a practical pairing of security advisories to VFCs, our general open-source implementation will allow vulnerability database maintainers to drastically improve data quality, supporting efforts to secure the software supply chain.},

@article{nguyen2023multi-granularity,
	abstract = {With the increasing reliance on Open Source Software, users are exposed to third-party library vulnerabilities. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools have been created to alert users of such vulnerabilities. SCA requires the identification of vulnerability-fixing commits. Prior works have proposed methods that can automatically identify such vulnerability-fixing commits. However, identifying such commits is highly challenging, as only a very small minority of commits are vulnerability fixing. Moreover, code changes can be noisy and difficult to analyze. We observe that noise can occur at different levels of detail, making it challenging to detect vulnerability fixes accurately. To address these challenges and boost the effectiveness of prior works, we propose MiDas (Multi-Granularity Detector for Vulnerability Fixes). Unique from prior works, MiDas constructs different neural networks for each level of code change granularity, corresponding to commit-level, file-level, hunk-level, and line-level, following their natural organization and then use an ensemble model combining all base models to output the final prediction. This design allows MiDas to better cope with the noisy and highly-imbalanced nature of vulnerability-fixing commit data. In addition, to reduce the human effort required to inspect code changes, we have designed an effort-aware adjustment for MiDas's outputs based on commit length. The evaluation result demonstrates that MiDas outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline on both Java and Python-based datasets in terms of AUC by 4.9% and 13.7%, respectively. Furthermore, in terms of two effort-aware metrics, i.e., EffortCost@L and Popt@L, MiDas also performs better than the state-of-the-art baseline up to 28.2% and 15.9% on Java, 60% and 51.4% on Python, respectively.},

@inproceedings{zhou2021finding,
	abstract = {Following the coordinated vulnerability disclosure model, a vulnerability in open source software (OSS) is sug-gested to be fixed "silently", without disclosing the fix until the vulnerability is disclosed. Yet, it is crucial for OSS users to be aware of vulnerability fixes as early as possible, as once a vulnerability fix is pushed to the source code repository, a malicious party could probe for the corresponding vulnerability to exploit it. In practice, OSS users often rely on the vulnerability disclosure information from security advisories (e.g., National Vulnerability Database) to sense vulnerability fixes. However, the time between the availability of a vulnerability fix and its disclosure can vary from days to months, and in some cases, even years. Due to manpower constraints and the lack of expert knowledge, it is infeasible for OSS users to manually analyze all code changes for vulnerability fix detection. Therefore, it is essential to identify vulnerability fixes automatically and promptly. In a first-of-its-kind study, we propose VulFixMiner, a Transformer-based approach, capable of automatically extracting semantic meaning from commit-level code changes to identify silent vulnerability fixes. We construct our model using sampled commits from 204 projects, and evaluate using the full set of commits from 52 additional projects. The evaluation results show that VulFixMiner outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of AUC (i.e., 0.81 and 0.73 on Java and Python dataset, respectively) and two effort-aware performance metrics (i.e., EffortCost, Popt). Especially, with an effort of inspecting 5% of total LOC, VulFixMiner can identify 49% of total vulnerability fixes. Additionally, with manual verification of sampled commits that were identified as vulnerability fixes, but not marked as such in our dataset, we observe that 35% (29 out of 82) of the commits are for fixing vulnerabilities, indicating VulFixMiner is also capable of identifying unreported vulnerability fixes.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, Open Source Software (OSS) has experienced rapid growth and widespread adoption, attributed to its openness and editability. However, this expansion has also brought significant security challenges, particularly introducing and propagating software vulnerabilities. Despite the use of machine learning and formal methods to tackle these issues, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive surveys that summarize and analyze both Vulnerability Detection (VD) and Security Patch Detection (SPD) in OSS. This article seeks to bridge this gap through an extensive survey that evaluates 127 technical studies published between 2014 and 2023, structured around the Vulnerability-Patch lifecycle. We begin by delineating the six critical events that constitute the Vulnerability-Patch lifecycle, leading to an in-depth exploration of the Vulnerability-Patch ecosystem. We then systematically review the databases commonly used in VD and SPD, and analyze their characteristics. Subsequently, we examine existing VD methods, focusing on traditional and deep learning based approaches. Additionally, we organize current security patch identification methods by kernel type and discuss techniques for detecting the presence of security patches. Based on our comprehensive review, we identify open research questions and propose future research directions that merit further exploration.},

@inproceedings{wang2019detecting,
	abstract = {Security patches in open source software (OSS) not only provide security fixes to identified vulnerabilities, but also make the vulnerable code public to the attackers. Therefore, armored attackers may misuse this information to launch N-day attacks on unpatched OSS versions. The best practice for preventing this type of N-day attacks is to keep upgrading the software to the latest version in no time. However, due to the concerns on reputation and easy software development management, software vendors may choose to secretly patch their vulnerabilities in a new version without reporting them to CVE or even providing any explicit description in their change logs. When those secretly patched vulnerabilities are being identified by armored attackers, they can be turned into powerful "0-day" attacks, which can be exploited to compromise not only unpatched version of the same software, but also similar types of OSS (e.g., SSL libraries) that may contain the same vulnerability due to code clone or similar design/implementation logic. Therefore, it is critical to identify secret security patches and downgrade the risk of those "0-day" attacks to at least "n-day" attacks. In this paper, we develop a defense system and implement a toolset to automatically identify secret security patches in open source software. To distinguish security patches from other patches, we first build a security patch database that contains more than 4700 security patches mapping to the records in CVE list. Next, we identify a set of features to help distinguish security patches from non-security ones using machine learning approaches. Finally, we use code clone identification mechanisms to discover similar patches or vulnerabilities in similar types of OSS. The experimental results show our approach can achieve good detection performance. A case study on OpenSSL, LibreSSL, and BoringSSL discovers 12 secret security patches.},

	abstract = {With the increasing usage of open-source software (OSS) components, vulnerabilities embedded within them are propagated to a huge number of underlying applications. In practice, the timely application of security patches in downstream software is challenging. The main reason is that such patches do not explicitly indicate their security impacts in the documentation, which would be difficult to recognize for software maintainers and users. However, attackers can still identify these ``secret'' security patches by analyzing the source code and generate corresponding exploits to compromise not only unpatched versions of the current software, but also other similar software packages that may contain the same vulnerability due to code cloning or similar design/implementation logic. Therefore, it is critical to identify these secret security patches to enable timely fixes. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based defense system called PatchRNN to automatically identify secret security patches in OSS. Besides considering descriptive keywords in the commit message (i.e., at the text level), we leverage both syntactic and semantic features at the source-code level. To evaluate the performance of our system, we apply it on a large-scale real-world patch dataset and conduct a case study on a popular open-source web server software - NGINX. Experimental results show that the PatchRNN can successfully detect secret security patches with a low false positive rate.},

@article{wu5555-enhancing,
	abstract = { With the rapid increasing number of open source software (OSS), the majority of the software vulnerabilities in the open source components are fixed silently, which leads to the deployed software that integrated them being unable to get a timely update. Hence, it is critical to design a security patch identification system to ensure the security of the utilized software. However, most of the existing works for security patch identification just consider the changed code and the commit message of a commit as a flat sequence of tokens with simple neural networks to learn its semantics, while the structure information is ignored. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose our well-designed approach E-SPI, which extracts the structure information hidden in a commit for effective identification. Specifically, it consists of the code change encoder to extract the syntactic of the changed code with the BiLSTM to learn the code representation and the message encoder to construct the dependency graph for the commit message with the graph neural network (GNN) to learn the message representation. We further enhance the code change encoder by embedding contextual information related to the changed code. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct the extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art approaches on the existing dataset and from the real deployment environment. The experimental results confirm that our approach can significantly outperform current state-of-the-art baselines. },

@article{zhou2021spi:,
	abstract = {Security patches in open source software, providing security fixes to identified vulnerabilities, are crucial in protecting against cyber attacks. Security advisories and announcements are often publicly released to inform the users about potential security vulnerability. Despite the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) publishes identified vulnerabilities, a vast majority of vulnerabilities and their corresponding security patches remain beyond public exposure, e.g., in the open source libraries that are heavily relied on by developers. As many of these patches exist in open sourced projects, the problem of curating and gathering security patches can be difficult due to their hidden nature. An extensive and complete security patches dataset could help end-users such as security companies, e.g., building a security knowledge base, or researcher, e.g., aiding in vulnerability research.To efficiently curate security patches including undisclosed patches at large scale and low cost, we propose a deep neural-network-based approach built upon commits of open source repositories. First, we design and build security patch datasets that include 38,291 security-related commits and 1,045 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) patches from four large-scale C programming language libraries. We manually verify each commit, among the 38,291 security-related commits, to determine if they are security related.We devise and implement a deep learning-based security patch identification system that consists of two composite neural networks: one commit-message neural network that utilizes pretrained word representations learned from our commits dataset and one code-revision neural network that takes code before revision and after revision and learns the distinction on the statement level. Our system leverages the power of the two networks for Security Patch Identification. Evaluation results show that our system significantly outperforms SVM and K-fold stacking algorithms. The result on the combined dataset achieves as high as 87.93\% F1-score and precision of 86.24\%.We deployed our pipeline and learned model in an industrial production environment to evaluate the generalization ability of our approach. The industrial dataset consists of 298,917 commits from 410 new libraries that range from a wide functionalities. Our experiment results and observation on the industrial dataset proved that our approach can identify security patches effectively among open sourced projects.},

	abstract = {Security patches play an important role in defending against the security threats brought by the increasing OSS vulnerabilities. However, the collection of security patches still remains a challenging problem. Existing works mainly adopt a matching-based design that uses auxiliary information in CVE/NVD to reduce the search scope of patch commits. However, our preliminary study shows that these approaches can only cover a small part of disclosed OSS vulnerabilities (about 12\%-53\%) even with manual assistance.To facilitate the collection of OSS security patches, this paper proposes a ranking-based approach, named PatchScout, which ranks the code commits in the OSS code repository based on their correlations to a given vulnerability. By exploiting the broad correlations between a vulnerability and code commits, patch commits are expected to be put to front positions in the ranked results. Compared with existing works, our approach could help to locate more security patches and meet a balance between the patch coverage and the manual efforts involved. We evaluate PatchScout with 685 OSS CVEs and the results show that it helps to locate 92.70\% patches with acceptable manual workload. To further demonstrate the utility of PatchScout, we perform a study on 5 popular OSS projects and 225 CVEs to understand the patch deployment practice across branches, and we obtain many new findings.},

	abstract = {The number of vulnerabilities in open source libraries is increasing rapidly. However, the majority of them do not go through public disclosure. These unidentified vulnerabilities put developers' products at risk of being hacked since they are increasingly relying on open source libraries to assemble and build software quickly. To find unidentified vulnerabilities in open source libraries and secure modern software development, we describe an efficient automatic vulnerability identification system geared towards tracking large-scale projects in real time using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. Built upon the latent information underlying commit messages and bug reports in open source projects using GitHub, JIRA, and Bugzilla, our K-fold stacking classifier achieves promising results on vulnerability identification. Compared to the state of the art SVM-based classifier in prior work on vulnerability identification in commit messages, we improve precision by 54.55\% while maintaining the same recall rate. For bug reports, we achieve a much higher precision of 0.70 and recall rate of 0.71 compared to existing work. Moreover, observations from running the trained model at SourceClear in production for over 3 months has shown 0.83 precision, 0.74 recall rate, and detected 349 hidden vulnerabilities, proving the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Despite the security community's best effort, the number of serious vulnerabilities discovered in software is increasing rapidly. In theory, security audits should find and remove the vulnerabilities before the code ever gets deployed. However, due to the enormous amount of code being produced, as well as a the lack of manpower and expertise, not all code is sufficiently audited. Thus, many vulnerabilities slip into production systems. A best-practice approach is to use a code metric analysis tool, such as Flawfinder, to flag potentially dangerous code so that it can receive special attention. However, because these tools have a very high false-positive rate, the manual effort needed to find vulnerabilities remains overwhelming. In this paper, we present a new method of finding potentially dangerous code in code repositories with a significantly lower false-positive rate than comparable systems. We combine code-metric analysis with metadata gathered from code repositories to help code review teams prioritize their work. The paper makes three contributions. First, we conducted the first large-scale mapping of CVEs to GitHub commits in order to create a vulnerable commit database. Second, based on this database, we trained a SVM classifier to flag suspicious commits. Compared to Flawfinder, our approach reduces the amount of false alarms by over 99 \% at the same level of recall. Finally, we present a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach and discuss lessons learned from the results. We will share the database as a benchmark for future research and will also provide our analysis tool as a web service.},

	abstract = { The lack of reliable sources of detailed information on the vulnerabilities of open-source software (OSS) components is a major obstacle to maintaining a secure software supply chain and an effective vulnerability management process. Standard sources of advisories and vulnerability data, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), are known to suffer from poor coverage and inconsistent quality. To reduce our dependency on these sources, we propose an approach that uses machine-learning to analyze source code repositories and to automatically identify commits that are security-relevant (i.e., that are likely to fix a vulnerability). We treat the source code changes introduced by commits as documents written in natural language, classifying them using standard document classification methods. Combining independent classifiers that use information from different facets of commits, our method can yield high precision (80%) while ensuring acceptable recall (43%). In particular, the use of information extracted from the source code changes yields a substantial improvement over the best known approach in state of the art, while requiring a significantly smaller amount of training data and employing a simpler architecture. },

	abstract = {Detecting vulnerability fix commits in open-source software is crucial for maintaining software security. To help OSS identify vulnerability fix commits, several automated approaches are developed. However, existing approaches like VulFixMiner and CoLeFunDa, focus solely on code changes, neglecting essential context from development artifacts. Tools like Vulcurator, which integrates issue reports, fail to leverage semantic associations between different development artifacts (e.g., pull requests and history vulnerability fixes). Moreover, they miss vulnerability fixes in tangled commits and lack explanations, limiting practical use. Hence to address those limitations, we propose LLM4VFD, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and In-Context Learning to improve the accuracy of vulnerability fix detection. LLM4VFD comprises three components: (1) Code Change Intention, which analyzes commit summaries, purposes, and implications using Chain-of-Thought reasoning; (2) Development Artifact, which incorporates context from related issue reports and pull requests; (3) Historical Vulnerability, which retrieves similar past vulnerability fixes to enrich context. More importantly, on top of the prediction, LLM4VFD also provides a detailed analysis and explanation to help security experts understand the rationale behind the decision. We evaluated LLM4VFD against state-of-the-art techniques, including Pre-trained Language Model-based approaches and vanilla LLMs, using a newly collected dataset, BigVulFixes. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM4VFD significantly outperforms the best-performed existing approach by 68.1%--145.4%. Furthermore, We conducted a user study with security experts, showing that the analysis generated by LLM4VFD improves the efficiency of vulnerability fix identification.},

@inproceedings{nguyen2022vulcurator:,
	abstract = {Open-source software (OSS) vulnerability management process is important nowadays, as the number of discovered OSS vulnerabilities is increasing over time. Monitoring vulnerability-fixing commits is a part of the standard process to prevent vulnerability exploitation. Manually detecting vulnerability-fixing commits is, however, time-consuming due to the possibly large number of commits to review. Recently, many techniques have been proposed to automatically detect vulnerability-fixing commits using machine learning. These solutions either: (1) did not use deep learning, or (2) use deep learning on only limited sources of information. This paper proposes VulCurator, a tool that leverages deep learning on richer sources of information, including commit messages, code changes and issue reports for vulnerability-fixing commit classification. Our experimental results show that VulCurator outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines up to 16.1\% in terms of F1-score.  

VulCurator tool is publicly available at https://github.com/ntgiang71096/VFDetector and https://zenodo.org/record/7034132# .Yw3MN-xBzDI, with a demo video at https://youtu.be/uMlFmWSJYOE},
