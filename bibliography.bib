	abstract = {The number of vulnerabilities in open source libraries is increasing rapidly. However, the majority of them do not go through public disclosure. These unidentified vulnerabilities put developers' products at risk of being hacked since they are increasingly relying on open source libraries to assemble and build software quickly. To find unidentified vulnerabilities in open source libraries and secure modern software development, we describe an efficient automatic vulnerability identification system geared towards tracking large-scale projects in real time using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. Built upon the latent information underlying commit messages and bug reports in open source projects using GitHub, JIRA, and Bugzilla, our K-fold stacking classifier achieves promising results on vulnerability identification. Compared to the state of the art SVM-based classifier in prior work on vulnerability identification in commit messages, we improve precision by 54.55\% while maintaining the same recall rate. For bug reports, we achieve a much higher precision of 0.70 and recall rate of 0.71 compared to existing work. Moreover, observations from running the trained model at SourceClear in production for over 3 months has shown 0.83 precision, 0.74 recall rate, and detected 349 hidden vulnerabilities, proving the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.},

@inproceedings{perl2015vccfinder:,
	abstract = {Despite the security community's best effort, the number of serious vulnerabilities discovered in software is increasing rapidly. In theory, security audits should find and remove the vulnerabilities before the code ever gets deployed. However, due to the enormous amount of code being produced, as well as a the lack of manpower and expertise, not all code is sufficiently audited. Thus, many vulnerabilities slip into production systems. A best-practice approach is to use a code metric analysis tool, such as Flawfinder, to flag potentially dangerous code so that it can receive special attention. However, because these tools have a very high false-positive rate, the manual effort needed to find vulnerabilities remains overwhelming. In this paper, we present a new method of finding potentially dangerous code in code repositories with a significantly lower false-positive rate than comparable systems. We combine code-metric analysis with metadata gathered from code repositories to help code review teams prioritize their work. The paper makes three contributions. First, we conducted the first large-scale mapping of CVEs to GitHub commits in order to create a vulnerable commit database. Second, based on this database, we trained a SVM classifier to flag suspicious commits. Compared to Flawfinder, our approach reduces the amount of false alarms by over 99 \% at the same level of recall. Finally, we present a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach and discuss lessons learned from the results. We will share the database as a benchmark for future research and will also provide our analysis tool as a web service.},

	abstract = { The lack of reliable sources of detailed information on the vulnerabilities of open-source software (OSS) components is a major obstacle to maintaining a secure software supply chain and an effective vulnerability management process. Standard sources of advisories and vulnerability data, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), are known to suffer from poor coverage and inconsistent quality. To reduce our dependency on these sources, we propose an approach that uses machine-learning to analyze source code repositories and to automatically identify commits that are security-relevant (i.e., that are likely to fix a vulnerability). We treat the source code changes introduced by commits as documents written in natural language, classifying them using standard document classification methods. Combining independent classifiers that use information from different facets of commits, our method can yield high precision (80%) while ensuring acceptable recall (43%). In particular, the use of information extracted from the source code changes yields a substantial improvement over the best known approach in state of the art, while requiring a significantly smaller amount of training data and employing a simpler architecture. },

	abstract = {Open-source software (OSS) vulnerability management process is important nowadays, as the number of discovered OSS vulnerabilities is increasing over time. Monitoring vulnerability-fixing commits is a part of the standard process to prevent vulnerability exploitation. Manually detecting vulnerability-fixing commits is, however, time-consuming due to the possibly large number of commits to review. Recently, many techniques have been proposed to automatically detect vulnerability-fixing commits using machine learning. These solutions either: (1) did not use deep learning, or (2) use deep learning on only limited sources of information. This paper proposes VulCurator, a tool that leverages deep learning on richer sources of information, including commit messages, code changes and issue reports for vulnerability-fixing commit classification. Our experimental results show that VulCurator outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines up to 16.1\% in terms of F1-score.  

VulCurator tool is publicly available at https://github.com/ntgiang71096/VFDetector and https://zenodo.org/record/7034132# .Yw3MN-xBzDI, with a demo video at https://youtu.be/uMlFmWSJYOE},
